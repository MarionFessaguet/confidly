# Confidly

Welcome to Confidly ‚Äî your privacy-first solution for sharing moments and memories with the people you trust.

> **Whether within a family or an organization, the same need arises:**  
> **A trusted space to share content with those who matter most.**

## How It Works

Confidly is fully verifiable and powered by iExec‚Äôs technology stack. iExec is The Trust Layer for DePIN & AI, providing the essential infrastructure for Ownership, Privacy, and Monetization.

Anyone can create and share memories with trusted editors.

Editors can then compile these shared memories into beautifully designed magazines, with the help of AI.

Our AI solution allows editors to effortlessly customize layout, tone, language, and more ‚Äî the possibilities are endless, and above all, completely hassle-free.

## Technical Deep Dive

Built on iExec's proven tools, memories are stored as protectedData using DataProtector.

Our dApp for magazine generation is rigorously tested and deployed with iExec's iAppGenerator and relies on Web3Mail.
