# Confidly

Here come confidly, your privacy base solution, to share your moments and memories with trusted people. 

> **Whether within a family or a company, the same expectation arises:**  
> **To have a trusted space to share content with those who matter.**

## How it works

Our stack is fully verifiable and run on iExec's stack. iExec is The Trust Layer for DePIN & AI, providing Infrastructure for Ownership, Privacy, and Monetization.

Anyone can come and freely share his memories and share them with trusted editors.

Editors can then later come and generate a magazine with several shared memories, benefiting from AI.

Our AI solution allow the editor to easily to customize the layout, tonality, language, ... posssibilities are endless, and above all, painless!


## Technical deep dive

Relying on iExec prooven tooling, memories are stored as protectedData through Data Protector.

Our dApp used to generate the magazine is securely tested and deployed with iExec's iAppGenerator and rely on Web3Wail.

## Remaining features

While our vision is clear, we're only starting our journey. 

Remining features are not yet implemented to fully match our vision:

* Prompt customization from the UI. Everything is ready under the hood being for the tone or output language (check our code ;) ).
* Making usage of Web3Mail for now some shortcut have been made.
* Letting editor select several memories. Everything is ready on our side, we're waiting the official launch of iExec promising multi-dataset and datapool features.
